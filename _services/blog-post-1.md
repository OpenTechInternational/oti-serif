# Small grants, big impacts

In early 2020, COVID hit us all by surprise. Suddenly, our lives had been turned inside out, with lockdowns, school closures, and massive disruptions to our future plans and current realities. 
 
One of the sectors that has been impacted greatly, but is not much spoken about, is the NGO sector. In particular, small organisations in the Global South that provide essential or sustainability-related services for communities have seen their supply chains disrupted, funding streams re-allocated, and priorities shifted. As the global pandemic grew its roots across humanity, donations shifted away from these organisations and towards the essential task of developing vaccines. 
 
At the same time, these small, grassroots organisations are on the front lines in terms of supporting communities to address the primary and secondary impacts of COVID. Where small amounts of money can provide significant impact for these organisations and their work, COVID has further demonstrated the crucial importance of these organisations and the work that they do. 
 
## COVID, Water and Hygiene
 
Small NGOs working in the Water Sanitation and Hygiene Sector (WaSH) play a critical role in supporting communities to provide improved sanitation – both in terms of infrastructure and in terms of education – to minimise the spread of disease.  Handwashing stations, suitable face masks, and community-based capacity building for community leaders and front-line health workers became the first line of defense. 

FRAPPE… 
 
## Rapid Response, Notable Impacts

Recognising the potential positive impacts that small amounts of money could have, FRAPPE and the International Water Centre Alumni Network (IWCAN) partnered to mobilise funding and to identify organisations and communities that needed it most. US $40,000 was raised through a brief but intense fundraising effort, which was allocated to six separate organisations located in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Nepal. The emphasis of the funding round was speed – the fundraising, grantee selection, dispersal of funds, and project reporting happened within an accelerated 6-month process. 

The call for proposals was shared within a small network of approximately 600 alumni of the International Water Centre and its associates. 15 total proposals were received during the two-week period of solicitation (May 14-28) from 15 countries, asking for a total of USD $113,679 to address COVID-19 related challenges. Proposals were then reviewed by an Expert Panel of five individual practitioners with extensive global experience in WaSH, public health, and fund management, who have worked for organizations including: Oxfam, UNICEF, AWP, WB, IFC, ADB & WaterAid. 
 
Over half a million people were able to directly benefit from the targeted projects. Grants for between US$3,600 and $10,000 allowed for organisations to address COVID bottlenecks and to be able to realign themselves to better support the communities that they serve through water, sanitation, and health interventions. 
 
The following projects/organisations received funds to implement their work:
* COVID and emergency support - Mara River Water User Association
* Nairobi slum relief – Hifadhi
* Mukono facemask company - Eco Sanitary Uganda
* Kavreplanchok water system - Gravity Water
* Kigoma Hospitals - Water Mission
* Touchless Handwashing Stations - Baadaye Technologies
 
The grant management team is now exploring systems and approaches to better serve its donors and its grantees for future rounds of funding.
