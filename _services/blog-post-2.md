# The Bottleneck Fund Process: reflections from the grant management team

Grant-making is an art, not a science. Although IWCAN had experience in administering awards — from recruiting award candidates, to setting up and managing selection panels to selecting winners — running a competitive grant as a small organisation relying completely on volunteer efforts was not an easy task.
 
## Moving money to where it’s needed most
 
Even in this age of global interconnectedness, getting money from one part of the world to where it’s most needed is not an easy process, and it is definitely not without fees. Where large companies famously set up accounts to circumnavigate taxes and transfer costs, sending small amounts of funds as an NGO to other NGOs in Africa, for example, requires that administrative systems and legal reporting mechanisms are in place to ensure that no there is no unlawful intention. The administrative burden is not insignificant, and many services require not only all of the necessary paperwork, but also the use of established accounts and straightforward process systems in place. 
 
For example, why was a Director based in France, representing an organisation in Australia trying to send a few thousand US dollars to Uganda through an international account? I spoke directly with financial vendor representatives, and even after sending through all legal documentation, still they were not comfortable to proceed with our grantmaking financial transfer. 
 
Small amounts of money are not easy to move around the world unless you are willing to pay significant fees or percentages – but where every dollar counted, this was not an option for us. 
 
## The value of trusted networks and partnerships
 
One of the key partners supporting the bottleneck funds has been Young Water Solutions, an international non-profit organization that aims to develop and support the potential of young people to contribute to universal water, sanitation hygiene and water resources management. YWS not only helped us to identify some of our outstanding grantees, but was able to support the disbursement of funds using their long-established banking infrastructure. Without the support of YWS, there is no way we would have either identified and secured half of our outstanding grantees, nor have been able to provide them with the funds quickly so that they could get their critical work underway.
 
Furthermore, since our donors were US-based, it was important that they received tax deductions for their charitable donations. This valuable service, however, was not something that our Australia-based NGO was able to provide – only US charities are able to secure US tax deductions. Luckily, we were able to partner with Gravity Water to not only support their important work in Nepal but also to be able to directly receive donor funds and secure the necessary paperwork for donors to secure their tax deductions. 
 
## Financial reporting and compliance
 
Whether money amounts are large or small, financial reporting requirements and legal compliance are still essential for any NGO. Every dollar that has been spent by grantees needs to be accounted for in reports, and it needs to be in line with the budget that has been approved prior to being awarded funds. So, what to do with scribbled receipts in local languages in various currencies? The burden of verification and accounting falls upon the granting organisation and the grant managers – again volunteers. Being able to report expenditures back to donors, other funding entities, project partners, and IWCAN’s Board of Directors is an important requirement to demonstrate effective use of funds. 
 
The need for developing a small grants financial reporting and accounting system to meet global accounting standard has emerged as a priority for the grant management team and for IWCAN as the administering organisation. 
 
The dream of being able to collect and disburse small amounts of money to organisations that need it most requires robust and streamlined system processes. The learning that has resulted from the implementation of the first round of Bottleneck Funds has been tremendous, and we hope, has provided us with a level of insight and experience that will eventually allow us to function more efficiently, and also allow us to support other organisations taking on similar processes.
