# Introducing Open Tech International

The need for a US-based NGO to receive US donor funds and support the allocation of funds to organisations that need it most became obvious through the Bottleneck Fund process, where US$40,000 was granted to organisations in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Nepal to address primary and secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020. 

Our Australian-based NGO was an established, credible organisation with systems on place to support this initial, small round of funding, but if we were to scale up the effort, new systems and a new organisation would be required. Open Tech International, thus, is born, as a US 501c3 organisation dedicated to serving other communities and organisations, focusing on the Global South, through the development of free or low-cost technological solutions to address critical needs for addressing humanitarian and development challenges at the local level.
 
## Smart tech, international development, and Effective Altruism
 
An initial task has been to research and deploy systems to address the following question: How can small grant schemes be streamlined and how can systems be improved using existing technologies? A small team of volunteers from the Effective Altruism has been working to answer this question and respond to these needs during these first months of 2021. The purpose of this project has been to identify best systems and best technological solutions that can be put in place for the following components of the grant process: receiving donor funds; submitting and selecting grantees; disbursing funds; international standard accounting and reporting. The team has been working to develop either free or minimal cost options to streamline these processes. 
 
More broadly, these approaches will be made into accessible open-source documentation for other NGOs working across the globe to be able to apply in their contexts.
 
## Open Tech International and partnerships in International Development
 
More broadly, OTI looks to support organisations working to address critical challenges with suitable, cost-effective (or free, ideally) tech solutions. To achieve this, OTI bridges the tech community with grassroots NGOs and community organisations to address social, environmental and sustainability challenges. From the digitization of knowledge to creating databases and/or easier ways to receive donations and report on their use and impact, OTI will work with its partners to find or develop suitable, usable, low cost or free solutions.
