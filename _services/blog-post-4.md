# Measuring the Overall Impact of Bottleneck Funds

## So… what can you get for $40K anyways?
 
International development is a large ticket global industry. With a record US$152.8 billion spent in 2019 to support global development goals, US$40,000 may seem insignificant in comparison. However, as we’ve asserted previously, big things can come from small, smart, targeted donations. So – what does $40,000 look like in 2020 in terms of on the ground impact?
 
### Improved Handwashing 
 
Our impact assessment indicates that approximately 250,000 people received access to improved handwashing facilities as a direct consequence of our projects and Bottleneck Funding:
* 6 hospitals that serve 4,000 people per day or 120,000 people per year (Kigoma, Tanzania)
* 6 hospitals, 2 health centers and 9 markets recording over 85,000 handwashes in the first month and impacting up to 200,000 people (Uganda)
* 10 community locations (Lemek, Kenya)
* 8 children's homes (average population 735), 1 home for the elderly (average population 203), and 1 home for the disabled (Githurai, Kenya)
 
In addition, the necessary supplies were provided where they were most needed to guarantee the safety and effectiveness of handwashing:
* 1000 liters of liquid soap (332 liters to 38 health facilities and 168 to key district departments) (Uganda)
* A year of soap to 6 hospitals (Kigoma, Tanzania)
* 315 litres of sanitizer and 100 litres of liquid detergent (3 slums in Kenya)
* 11,275 bars of soap for a 12-month supply for 6000 families (Kavrepalanchowk, Nepal)
 
### Emergency Food Provisions
 
Bottleneck Fund projects provided emergency food provisions to approximately 6,000 people in Kenya:
* 170 vulnerable community members in region cut-off by floods (Lemek, Kenya)
* 65 families (Kibari, Kenya)
* 8 children's homes (average population 735), 1 home for the elderly (average population 203), and 1 home for the disabled (Githurai, Kenya)
* Additional food distributed through the Rotary District 9212 and National Youth Service (Mathare, Kenya)
 
### Facemasks provided and training on making facemasks
 
Approximately 5,000 people were directly supported through receiving facemasks through the bottleneck funds. In addition to the following facemasks that were distributed to protect public health, 30 people in Lemek, Kenya were trained to make facemasks from ordinary, locally available materials. 
* 2000 disposable facemasks (Lemek, Kenya)
* 2000 reusable facemasks to 310 medical officers at 38 health facilities and 690 local government officials (Uganda)
* 925 reusable facemasks (3 slums in Kenya)
 
### Safe drinking water supply provided
 
Additionally, approximately 6,000 people in Kavrepalanchowk, Nepal were provided with a safe drinking water supply – which previously the did not have during the monsoon season. 
 
### Community outreach and training
 
And finally, 1,615 people received training through community outreach in Lemek, Kenya. The target audiences who received this support were those who needed it most: 370 women/widows, 1,030 youth and 215 people living with disabilities. In addition, 30 local awareness trainers were trained to carry on the community outreach work beyond the project duration, also in Lemek, Kenya.
